But when Jackson asks for his help defending Kaden Cameron, Ellery is out of his depth--and not just with guarded, prickly Jackson. Kaden wasn't just framed, he was framed by crooked cops, and the conspiracy goes higher than Ellery dares reach--and deep into Jackson's troubled past.\\nBoth men are soon enmeshed in the mystery of who killed the cop in the minimart, and engaged in a race against time to clear Kaden's name. But when the mystery is solved and the bullets stop flying, they'll have to deal with their personal complications... and an attraction that's spiraled out of control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        mystery, thriller, crime, romance                                                                                     https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1467239908m/30813756.jpg  1541           160                 253             336             110             31              13              743            4.1         51296427, 49859665, 47750530, 43186733                                                                          1\n",
